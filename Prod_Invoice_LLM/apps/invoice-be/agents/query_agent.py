    Known tradeoff, accepted rather than silently shipped: the keyword pass

    fast path trades some of it for speed on the common, unambiguous cases.

    first was handled originally, so multi-value and partial-match questions kept
    missing rows the way exact-match ones did before this function existed):

    - `column = 'value'`            -> `TRIM(LOWER(column)) = TRIM(LOWER('value'))`

    what it matches (`' Harbor%'` and `'Harbor%'` are different patterns). `LOWER` is safe
    on a pattern because it leaves the `%`/`_` wildcards untouched. The column side is
    still trimmed, which is where the stored-value whitespace drift actually lives.

    `NOT IN` / `NOT LIKE` are handled by the same passes so a negated filter doesn't
    quietly keep the old case-sensitive behaviour. `ILIKE` is left alone — it is already

- tags: JSONB (list of tags as strings, e.g. ["urgent", "software"])
- items: JSONB (list of line item objects, each having: description, quantity, unit_price, amount)

Write a SQL query to answer the user's question.
CRITICAL RULES:
1. You MUST filter by tenant_id = '{tenant_id}'.
2. You MUST only generate a read-only SELECT statement.
3. IMPORTANT: Audit status lives exclusively in the `status` enum and `sa_alerts` column. There is no `audit_flags`, `audit_logs`, or `audit_reasons` table. Do not hallucinate columns like `is_flagged_for_audit`.
4. IMPORTANT: a question about a vendor/bill received ("who do I owe", "what did I pay X") means flow_direction='INBOUND', filtered by vendor_name. A question about a customer/invoice sent ("who owes me", "what did I bill X") means flow_direction='OUTBOUND', filtered by customer_name. Never mix the two columns for the wrong direction.
5. For a combined/net question comparing both directions in one answer (e.g. "how much do I owe vs. how much is owed to me"), use conditional aggregation in one query rather than two separate ones, for example:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN flow_direction='INBOUND'  THEN grand_total ELSE 0 END) AS total_owed_by_us,
  SUM(CASE WHEN flow_direction='OUTBOUND' THEN grand_total ELSE 0 END) AS total_owed_to_us
FROM invoice WHERE tenant_id = '{tenant_id}'

6. If the user query refers to a tag or line-item description/detail, you can query the tags and items JSONB columns using simple LIKE filters. ALWAYS wrap both sides in LOWER(...) -- tags and line-item descriptions are free text and are not reliably lowercase (e.g. "Ergonomic Office Chair"), and a case-sensitive match will silently miss real rows:
   - To check if a tag (e.g. 'hardware') is in tags: LOWER(tags) LIKE LOWER('%"hardware"%') (works in both SQLite and Postgres)
   - To search for a keyword (e.g. 'laptop') in line-item descriptions: LOWER(items) LIKE LOWER('%laptop%') (works in both SQLite and Postgres)
6a. IMPORTANT -- vendor_name/customer_name filters: NEVER use exact equality (=) to filter by vendor_name or customer_name. Users routinely refer to a vendor/customer by a shortened or informal name (e.g. "Cascade Manufacturing" when the stored value is "Cascade Manufacturing Co") -- an exact match will silently return zero rows for a real, existing vendor. ALWAYS use a case-insensitive partial match instead: LOWER(vendor_name) LIKE LOWER('%Cascade Manufacturing%'). This applies even when the user's question phrases it as if it were an exact name.
7. CRITICAL CURRENCY RULE: Whenever you query monetary columns (like grand_total, tax_amount, subtotal, or line-item amount), you MUST ALSO select the `currency` column in the query so the currency context is preserved in the results (e.g., SELECT grand_total, currency FROM invoice ...).
8. If the query requires columns or filters that are completely unsupported or non-existent in the schema, set the `sql` field to null in the schema response and explain why in `explanation_or_error`.
